    What is the difference between "this()" and "super()" ?
    "this()" is for calling constructor from the class itself.

    //When you create an object, you can select data type of the object from the class itself
    //or from the parent classes.



      13) If a variable exists in a Class Java uses the variable from the class itself
14) If a class does not have the requested variable in it, Java looks for the variable in the parent classes
15) If you use "this" inside the constructor, it means you are calling a variable from the class itself
16) If you use "super" inside the constructor, it means you are calling a variable from the first level paent class.
